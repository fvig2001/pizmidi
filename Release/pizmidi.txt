* Added midiNoteToggle
* Implemented hanging note protection in midiForceToKey, midiForceToRange, and midiInvertNotes
* Changes in host's sample rate are now detected in midiSimpleLFO and midiAudioToCC

* Added midiNRPNConverter
* Updated midiConverter with many more conversion types, and renamed it to midiConverter2
* Linux and OS X versions updated with changes from 20071222 as well (see below)

* Removed XT2 transport control (still available separately)
* Removed midiCCToTempo
* Plugins will now automatically become "instrument" VSTs in hosts that need it
* Removed separate instrument versions

changes 20071124:
* Added midi16CCRouter.
* midiAudioToCC now has somewhat working "inertia" and "rate" parameters. not perfect yet.
* next time i might remove XT2 transport control

changes 20071112:
* midi2qwerty and midiForceToKey now have a "program" parameter. automate it to change the current program. also increased the number of programs to 128, so automating it with a CC will correspond exactly to the program number.
* midiVelocityScale can now also affect the release velocity, separate from the note-on velocity.

changes 20071101:
* all plugins now use rounding instead of truncation when creating MIDI values. in most cases this will be better, but some old patches might be affected. this change hasn't been thoroughly tested.
* added audio output to midiAudioToCC so it will work in Live
* improvements to midi2qwerty (keydown and keyup are now sent separately in some cases; also added more keys, more triggering modes, and MIDI output)

changes 20071031:
* experimental build with VST SDK version 2.4 (was 2.3 previously).
* "instrument" versions for Live and Cubase.
* linux and mac versions finally updated.
* maybe other small improvements (i forgot already).

changes 20071030:
* minor initialization improvement in all plugins.

changes 20071026:
* updated the LFO again. now it will always be in phase in beat-sync/tempo mode, rather than waiting until the next bar.

changes 20071025:
* fixed more bugs in midiSimpleLFO and added a "slow" random mode (one message per cycle).

changes 20071024:
* fixed a few (bad) bugs in the beat-triggered mode of midiSimpleLFO.
* compiled midiChs_noGUI as an "effect" to match the others

changes 20071023:
* improved midiSimpleLFO - more sync and triggering modes
* improved midi2qwerty - full keyboard now accessible, and there are now two CC trigger modes: CC+ (127) and CC- (0).
* both of these may break old patches, so use them carefully.
